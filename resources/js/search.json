My work revolves around designing and implementing state-of-the-art security protocols, ensuring they adhere to industry standards and guidelines such as NIST and ISO.","A key aspect of my role is translating complex business requirements into secure, scalable, and high-performance security solutions. I work on the design and implementation of authentication and authorization systems, leveraging protocols such as OAuth and OpenID Connect. Additionally, I focus on credential protection for both enterprise and consumer environments. On the enterprise side, I work with Active Directory, while on the consumer side, I focus on Continuous Authentication. My projects involve architecting secure access control mechanisms, developing robust identity verification processes, and optimizing authentication workflows to balance security with seamless user experience.","Through a combination of protocol engineering, cryptographic optimization, and threat modeling, I contribute to building resilient security infrastructures that safeguard identities, protect sensitive data, and enhance system-wide security."]},{"i":"cryptography-security-and-privacy-lab","l":"Cryptography, Security, and Privacy Lab","p":["Location : Waterloo, Canada","At CrySP Lab, I worked on system security and access control enforcement within the Android framework, focusing on identifying and mitigating security vulnerabilities in multi-user environments.

The first involved investigating access control vulnerabilities in Android’s multi-user framework, where I identified security inconsistencies that could lead to privilege escalation and unauthorized data access. The second project focused on detecting replica APIs within the Android framework, where I analyzed and identified duplicate APIs, aiming to reduce system bloat and mitigate security risks caused by redundant logic. Both projects contributed to improving Android’s security architecture by enhancing access control enforcement and optimizing the framework’s efficiency.","To support this research, I built custom Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools, automated vulnerability detection, and developed proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits to demonstrate real-world security threats.
